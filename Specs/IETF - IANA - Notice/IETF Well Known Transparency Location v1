## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Current data protection frameworks require controllers to provide transparency information to individuals, yet lack a standardized location for publishing this information in a machine-readable format. This creates several problems:

- **Discovery Challenge**: Individuals and automated systems cannot reliably locate controller accountability information
- **Verification Gap**: No standard mechanism exists for verifying controller identification before data processing begins
- **Enforcement Friction**: Regulatory authorities face high costs auditing compliance across fragmented transparency mechanisms
- **Rights Exercise Barriers**: Individuals struggle to determine where and how to exercise data protection rights

### 1.2 Solution Overview

This document defines a well-known URI location for publishing Controller Identification Records (CIRs) and associated transparency information. By establishing `/.well-known/transparency` as the standard location, this specification enables:

- **Automated Discovery**: Systems can reliably locate controller transparency information
- **Anonymous-by-Default Architecture**: Controllers identify themselves before requesting individual identification
- **Independent Verification**: Third parties can generate notice receipts using publicly available controller information
- **Regulatory Scalability**: Automated verification through public registries

### 1.3 Use Cases

**Consent Receipt Generation**: Individuals or their agents retrieve CIR to generate notice receipts documenting transparency state before providing consent.

**Rights Exercise**: Individuals locate the rights access point to exercise Convention 108+ data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability).

**Regulatory Enforcement**: Data protection authorities verify controller compliance through automated CIR validation against public registries.

**Cross-Border Transfers**: Controllers disclose recipient jurisdictions and transfer mechanisms, enabling informed consent for international data flows.

**Multi-Stakeholder Verification**: Researchers, civil society, and verification services independently assess controller transparency practices.

### 1.4 Relationship to Existing Standards

- **RFC 8615**: This specification uses the well-known URI framework for standardized resource discovery
- **ISO/IEC 27560:2025**: CIR structure aligns with PII processing record information structure
- **Convention 108+**: Transparency requirements operationalized through CIR publication
- **W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary**: Legal  semantic vocabulary and machine readable interoperability for privacy concepts

---

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Controller**: Natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which determines the purposes and means of processing personally identifiable information (PII). (Convention 108+ Article 2(d))

**Controller Identification Record (CIR)**: Structured grouping of publicly required controller information, enabling independent notice receipt generation and rights access.

**CIR-ID**: Unique public reference enabling registry verification and cross-jurisdictional lookup of controller identification.

**Notice Receipt**: Bilateral record documenting controller notification for PII processing under any legal basis, held by both controller and individual.

**Two-Factor Notice (2FN)**: Pattern where controller presents notice AND generates proof-of-notice record held by both parties.

**Rights Access Point**: URI or contact information enabling individuals to exercise Convention 108+ data subject rights.

**Scope of Disclosure**: Risk categorization determining proportionate transparency obligations (child, youth, vulnerable, community, regional, national, international).

---

## 3. Well-Known URI Registration

### 3.1 Registration Template

Per RFC 8615 Section 5, this document requests registration of the following well-known URI:

**URI suffix**: `transparency`

**Change controller**: IETF

**Specification document**: [this RFC]

**Related information**:

- ISO/IEC 27560:2025 (PII Processing Record Information Structure)
- Council of Europe Convention 108+ (Modernised Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data)
- ISO/IEC 29100:2011 (Privacy framework)

**Status**: permanent

### 3.2 URI Construction

Controllers SHALL publish their Controller Identification Record at:

```
https://<authority>/.well-known/transparency
```

Or with explicit file reference:

```
https://<authority>/.well-known/transparency/notice.txt
```

Both formats are semantically equivalent. Systems SHOULD check both locations, with `/.well-known/transparency` taking precedence.

### 3.3 Alternative Locations

For controllers without TLS certificates or specialized deployments, alternative publication locations MAY include:

- Root-level: `https://<authority>/notice.txt`
- Custom path with redirect: Any controller-specified location that redirects to the CIR

However, `/.well-known/transparency` is the RECOMMENDED standard location for automated discovery.

---

## 4. Controller Transparency Record Format

### 4.1 Media Type

CIR documents MUST be served with Content-Type `application/json` or `application/ld+json` for JSON-LD formatted records.

### 4.2 Required Fields

A conformant CIR MUST include:

**controller_identity_record_id** (string): Unique identifier (URI, DID, or legal entity identifier) enabling registry verification.

**controller_name** (string): Legal name of the controller entity.

**jurisdiction** (string): ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 or alpha-3 country code for controller's primary jurisdiction.

**rights_access_point** (string): URI or contact information for exercising data subject rights.

**lawful_basis_options** (array of strings): Legal bases available for processing (consent, contract, legal_obligation, legitimate_interest, vital_interest, public_interest).

**processing_purposes** (array of strings): Categories of processing purposes (service_delivery, analytics, marketing, research, etc.).

**scope_of_disclosure** (string): Risk category (child, youth, vulnerable, community, regional, national, international).

### 4.3 Optional Fields

**cir_publication_url** (string): Canonical URL for this CIR (typically the /.well-known/transparency location).

**notice_event_log_url** (string): Endpoint for querying notice state changes and material modifications.

**data_protection_officer** (object): Contact information for data protection officer if designated.

**policy_url** (string): Link to human-readable privacy policy.

**codes_of_conduct** (string or object): Reference to Convention 108+ or other applicable framework.

**processing_locations** (array of strings): ISO 3166-1 codes for data processing jurisdictions.

**recipient_jurisdictions** (array): For international scope of disclosure, destination jurisdictions for cross-border transfers.

**transfer_mechanism** (string): Legal mechanism for cross-border transfers (consent, adequacy, scc, bcr, etc.).

**surveillance_risks** (object): Disclosure of government access risks in recipient jurisdictions (when transfer_mechanism="consent").

### 4.4 Privacy Preference Signals

Controllers MAY declare support for privacy preference mechanisms through the **privacy_preference_signals** object:

**gpc_honored** (boolean): Whether controller honors W3C Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. When true, controller commits to treating GPC as a valid opt-out of sale/sharing under applicable laws.

**gpc_scope** (array of strings): Specific processing purposes affected by GPC (e.g., ["marketing", "analytics", "third_party_sharing"]). Required when gpc_honored=true.

**dnt_honored** (boolean): Whether controller recognizes Do Not Track (DNT) browser signal.

**preference_center_url** (string): URI where individuals can manage granular privacy preferences without authentication.

**preference_binding** (string): How preferences are recorded (values: "browser_signal", "receipt_anchored", "account_based").

Example:

```json
"privacy_preference_signals": {
  "gpc_honored": true,
  "gpc_scope": ["marketing", "analytics", "third_party_sharing"],
  "dnt_honored": false,
  "preference_center_url": "https://example.com/privacy/preferences",
  "preference_binding": "receipt_anchored"
}
```

**Rationale**: Privacy preference signals enable **transparency before identification**. Individuals can verify controller commitment to preference mechanisms before providing any personal data, supporting anonymous-by-default architecture.

### 4.5 Transparency Assurance and Trust Indicators

Controllers MAY declare transparency assurance levels and certification status through structured fields:

**transparency_assurance_level** (string): Level of transparency implementation per ISO/IEC 27560 MVCR-ANCR framework. Values:

- `L1_self_assertion`: Controller self-publishes CIR and notice.txt (baseline)
- `L2_registered`: CIR-ID registered with data protection authority
- `L3_ancr_signaling`: Anchored Notice Consent Receipts with cryptographic signatures
- `L4_active_state`: Real-time active-state signaling with certified notarization

**trustmark_certifications** (array of objects): Independent verifications and certifications. Each object contains:

- `trustmark_type` (string): Certification type ("habni", "tpi_r", "privacy_seal", "bcr_approval")
- `issuing_authority` (string): Name of certifying body or data protection authority
- `certification_id` (string): Unique identifier for this certification
- `issue_date` (string): ISO 8601 date of certification issuance
- `expiry_date` (string, optional): ISO 8601 date when certification expires
- `verification_url` (string): URI for independent verification of certification status
- `score` (number, optional): Numeric score for assessment-based certifications (e.g., TPI-R score 0-100)

**visual_trust_indicator** (object, optional): Machine-readable trust indicator for user agent rendering:

- `indicator_type` (string): Visual indicator type ("badge", "color_signal", "trust_score")
- `indicator_value` (string): Specific indicator (e.g., "green", "verified", "85")
- `indicator_url` (string): URI to official indicator icon or badge image

Example:

```json
"transparency_assurance_level": "L3_ancr_signaling",
"trustmark_certifications": [
  {
    "trustmark_type": "habni",
    "issuing_authority": "Digital Transparency Lab",
    "certification_id": "HABNI-2025-001234",
    "issue_date": "2025-01-15",
    "expiry_date": "2026-01-15",
    "verification_url": "https://registry.transparencylab.ca/verify/HABNI-2025-001234"
  },
  {
    "trustmark_type": "tpi_r",
    "issuing_authority": "Kantara Initiative",
    "certification_id": "TPI-R-2025-CA-567",
    "issue_date": "2025-02-01",
    "verification_url": "https://kantarainitiative.org/tpi-r/verify/567",
    "score": 87
  }
],
"visual_trust_indicator": {
  "indicator_type": "badge",
  "indicator_value": "verified_L3",
  "indicator_url": "https://standards.transparencylab.ca/badges/L3_ancr.svg"
}
```

**Rationale**: Transparency assurance levels create market differentiation for controllers implementing higher-assurance transparency practices. User agents (browsers, privacy tools) can render appropriate trust indicators, enabling informed individual choice. Regulatory dashboards can filter and prioritize enforcement based on assurance levels.

### 4.6 Global Privacy Rights Controls (GPRC)

Controllers MAY declare context-specific rights availability through the **global_privacy_rights_controls** array. GPRC enables mapping of data subject rights across the 72 transparency contexts defined by the ISO/IEC 27560 MVCR-ANCR framework:

**Transparency Context Matrix**: 3 data control vectors × 4 TATA levels × 6 legal bases = 72 distinct transparency contexts

Each GPRC entry is an object containing:

**context_id** (string): Unique identifier for this transparency context (format: "VECTOR_LEVEL_BASIS")

**data_control_vector** (string): One of:

- `personal_control`: Individual self-identifies and manages own data (SSI/DID paradigm)
- `data_protection`: Federated identification where third parties identify individuals
- `co_regulation`: ISO/IEC 27560 MVCR-ANCR profile with standardized notice-and-consent

**transparency_assurance_level** (string): One of L1_self_assertion, L2_registered, L3_ancr_signaling, L4_active_state

**legal_basis** (string): One of consent, contract, legal_obligation, legitimate_interest, vital_interest, public_interest

**available_rights** (array of strings): Rights exercisable in this context:

- `access`: Right to obtain confirmation and copy of personal data
- `rectification`: Right to correct inaccurate personal data
- `erasure`: Right to deletion (right to be forgotten)
- `portability`: Right to receive and transfer data in structured format
- `restriction`: Right to restrict processing
- `objection`: Right to object to processing
- `automated_decision_opt_out`: Right to opt out of automated decision-making

**rights_exercise_mechanism** (string): How rights are exercised in this context:

- `api`: RESTful API endpoint for programmatic rights exercise
- `web_form`: Human-accessible web form
- `email`: Email-based rights request
- `notice_receipt_anchored`: Rights exercise bound to notice receipt identifier
- `preference_signal`: Browser signal (GPC) treated as rights exercise

**rights_api_endpoint** (string, optional): URI for programmatic rights exercise when mechanism="api"

**response_timeframe** (string): ISO 8601 duration for controller response (e.g., "P30D" = 30 days per Convention 108+)

**authentication_required** (boolean): Whether authentication is required for rights exercise in this context

**verification_method** (string, optional): How individual identity is verified when authentication_required=true (e.g., "notice_receipt_id", "email_verification", "account_credentials")

Example GPRC configurations:

    "verification_method": "did_authentication"
  }
]
```

**GPRC Integration with Notice Event Logs**:

When individuals exercise rights through any GPRC mechanism, controllers SHOULD record the rights exercise event in the notice event log referenced by `notice_event_log_url`. This creates auditable transparency state changes tracked across all 72 contexts.

**Rationale**: GPRC transforms the CIR from static disclosure into **dynamic rights management infrastructure**. By explicitly mapping available rights to transparency contexts, this specification enables:

1. **Context-Aware Rights Exercise**: User agents can programmatically determine which rights are available based on current legal basis, Trust Assurance level, and data control vector
2. **Automated Rights APIs**: Privacy tools can invoke rights exercise endpoints without human intervention
3. **Regulatory Verification**: Data protection authorities can verify rights availability across all 72 contexts and track compliance at scale
4. **Preference Signal Integration**: GPC and other browser signals can be mapped to specific rights exercise in appropriate contexts
5. **Transparency Without Identification**: Rights exercise mechanisms can be designed for anonymous or pseudonymous verification using notice receipt identifiers

GPRC enables proportionate rights exercise: different legal bases and assurance levels provide different rights (e.g., erasure available under consent but restricted under legitimate interest with balancing test).

### 4.7 Example CIR (Minimal)

```

---

## 5. Discovery Protocol

### 5.1 HTTP Request

Clients discover CIR by sending HTTP GET request:

```
GET /.well-known/transparency HTTP/1.1
Host: [example.com](http://example.com)
Accept: application/json
```

### 5.2 HTTP Response

Successful response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400

{CIR JSON content}
```

### 5.3 Error Handling

**404 Not Found**: Controller has not published CIR. Clients MAY check alternative location `/notice.txt`.

**403 Forbidden**: Access restrictions SHOULD NOT be applied to CIR (public accountability record).

**500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side failure. Clients SHOULD retry with exponential backoff.

### 5.4 Caching

CIR documents SHOULD include Cache-Control headers. Recommended: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` (24 hours).

Clients SHOULD respect cache directives while also checking `notice_event_log_url` for material changes.

### 5.5 Content Negotiation

Servers MAY support multiple representations:

```
Accept: application/json
Accept: application/ld+json
Accept: text/html (for human-readable rendering)
```

---

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 No PII in CIR

CIR documents MUST NOT contain personally identifiable information. CIR contains only controller accountability information, making public disclosure safe.

### 6.2 Controller Identification Verification

CIR-ID MUST be verifiable through authoritative registries to prevent controller impersonation. Implementers SHOULD:

- Cross-reference CIR-ID with legal entity registries (e.g., business registrations)
- Verify jurisdiction claims against authoritative sources
- Validate TLS certificates match controller_name when using HTTPS

### 6.3 Integrity Protection

While TLS is RECOMMENDED for CIR publication, it is not REQUIRED since CIR contains no confidential information. However:

- Controllers publishing CIR over HTTP SHOULD provide cryptographic signatures
- Clients SHOULD verify signatures when available
- Registry-based verification provides additional integrity assurance

### 6.4 Denial of Service

Controllers SHOULD implement rate limiting on `/.well-known/transparency` to prevent abuse:

- Reasonable rate limits: 100 requests/minute per IP address
- Aggressive caching reduces load
- CDN distribution recommended for high-traffic controllers

### 6.5 Registry Security

CIR registries operated by data protection authorities or other verifiers MUST:

- Authenticate controller identification before CIR-ID issuance
- Maintain audit logs of CIR updates
- Provide secure APIs for automated verification
- Implement DDoS protection

---

## 7. Privacy Considerations

### 7.1 Anonymous-by-Default Architecture

CIR publication enables **controller identification before individual identification**. This architectural principle:

- Allows individuals to verify controller identification anonymously
- Enables notice receipt generation without providing PII
- Supports surveillance-resistant transparency verification

### 7.2 No Authentication Required

CIR access MUST NOT require authentication. Requiring login would:

- Defeat anonymous discovery
- Create identification-before-transparency anti-pattern
- Introduce tracking risks

### 7.3 Transparency Without Surveillance

Public CIR registries enable regulatory oversight **without** creating individual surveillance infrastructure:

- Regulators verify controller transparency practices
- No individual-level tracking required for enforcement
- Registry queries reference controllers, not individuals

### 7.4 Privacy-Enabling Rights Exercise

**Terminology Note**: This specification uses "privacy-enabling" rather than "privacy-preserving" to reflect a fundamental paradigm shift. **Privacy-enabling** means individuals control their own data and identifiers without requiring corporate identification or permission (individual-centric data control). **Privacy-preserving** means companies protect data better on behalf of individuals (controller-centric data protection). The CIR infrastructure is regulatory capacity infrastructure for enforcement at scale, not compliance tools for companies.

The `rights_access_point` field enables individuals to exercise PII principal and data subject rights. Controllers SHOULD:

- Support privacy-enabling rights exercise mechanisms
- Allow anonymous rights requests where legally permissible
- Minimize authentication requirements for rights access

---

## 8. IANA Considerations

This document requests IANA to register the following well-known URI in the "Well-Known URIs" registry as defined by RFC 8615.

### 8.1 Registration Request

**URI suffix**: transparency

**Change controller**: IETF

**Specification document**: [this RFC]

**Related information**:

- ISO/IEC 27560:2025 - Structure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Processing Records

## Appendix A. Implementation Guidance

### A.1 For Controllers

**Step 1: Generate CIR-ID**

Obtain unique identifier from:

- Legal entity registries (business registration number)
- Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- Controller registry operated by data protection authority

**Step 2: Create CIR JSON**

Populate required fields with accurate controller identification information. Ensure `rights_access_point` is operational.

**Step 3: Publish at Well-Known Location**

Configure web server to serve CIR at `/.well-known/transparency` with `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Step 4: Register with Authorities (Optional but Recommended)**

Add, or Submit where applicable,  CIR-ID to data protection authority registration or registry for verification and public listing.

**Step 5: Maintain Notice Event Log**

Track material changes to processing practices. Provide queryable endpoint at `notice_event_log_url`.

### A.2 For Individuals and User Agents

**Step 1: Discover CIR**

Before providing data, retrieve controller CIR:

```
GET https://example.com/.well-known/transparency
```

**Step 2: Verify Controller Identification**

Cross-reference `controller_identity_record_id` with public registries.

**Step 3: Generate Notice Receipt (Optional)**

Combine CIR with context (timestamp, notice type, legal basis) to create bilateral notice receipt.

**Step 4: Exercise Rights**

Use `rights_access_point` to submit access, rectification, erasure, or portability requests.

### A.3 For Regulators

**Step 1: Establish CIR Registry**

Operate public registry of verified CIR-IDs with controller identification information.

**Step 2: Automated Verification**

Crawl `/.well-known/transparency` endpoints to verify controller transparency compliance.

**Step 3: Enforce Transparency Requirements**

Identify controllers lacking CIR publication or with incomplete transparency information.

**Step 4: International Coordination**

Federate CIR registries across jurisdictions for cross-border transfer verification.

## Appendix B. Comparison with Existing Mechanisms

### B.1 vs. Privacy Policies

**Traditional Privacy Policies**:

- Unstructured HTML documents
- No standard location
- Human-readable only
- Difficult to verify or compare

**CIR at /.well-known/transparency**:

- Structured JSON format
- Standard well-known location
- Machine-readable with human rendering
- Automated verification possible

### B.2 vs. robots.txt

`robots.txt` provides precedent for root-level disclosure files. However:

- robots.txt governs crawler behavior (technical)
- CIR governs data processing (legal/privacy)
- Both benefit from standardized locations

### B.3 vs. security.txt (RFC 9116)

`security.txt` (RFC 9116) uses `/.well-known/security.txt` for security contact disclosure. This specification follows similar pattern:

- Standard well-known location
- Machine-readable structured format
- Public accountability information
- No authentication required

## Appendix C. Future Extensions

### C.1 Signed CIR

Future work may specify cryptographic signatures for CIR integrity:

- JSON Web Signatures (JWS) per RFC 7515
- Verifiable Credentials per W3C specification
- Integration with controller public key infrastructure

### C.2 Multi-Controller Coordination

For complex processing involving multiple controllers:

- CIR chaining for third-party disclosure transparency
- Joint controller CIR references
- Processor transparency through controller CIR links

### C.3 Dynamic State Signaling

Real-time transparency state changes:

- Server-Sent Events or WebSockets for live notice event log
- Active-state signaling for high-assurance contexts
- Push notifications for material changes

## Acknowledgments

This specification builds on years of work by the Kantara Initiative Consent & Information Sharing Work Group, the Digital Transparency Lab, and the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 community.

Key contributors to the underlying Controller Identification Record concept and ISO/IEC 27560 profile development include: Mark Lizar (Digital Transparency Lab), Sal D’Agositno (IDmachines) and the ANCR Working Group participants.

The well-known URI framework defined in RFC 8615 by Mark Nottingham provided the foundation for this standardized discovery mechanism.
