# 0PN Lab

**0PN RF-RAND IPR License (v1.0)**

---

**0PN Lab** publishes the specifications and schemas in this repository as Digital Public Transparency Infrastructure.

This license is intended to:
- enable **royalty-free implementation** of the normative requirements of the Specification(s), and
- protect the ecosystem from patent aggression through **defensive termination**.

## 1. Definitions

**Affiliate** means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity. “Control” means beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the voting power or equity (or equivalent decision power).

**Covered Materials** means the Specification(s) and other materials in this repository that are explicitly designated as governed by this license. Covered Materials typically include:
- specifications in `spec/`
- schemas in `schemas/`
- conformance artifacts in `conformance/`, `test-vectors/`, or similar directories

**Essential Claims** means those claims of a patent or patent application, in any jurisdiction, that would necessarily be infringed by implementing the **Normative Portions** of a Specification, where there is no commercially reasonable non-infringing alternative. Existence of a non-infringing alternative is judged based on the state of the art at the time the relevant Specification version is published.

**Licensee** means any individual or organization (including its Affiliates) that makes, uses, sells, offers for sale, imports, or distributes a Conformant Implementation.

**Normative Portions** means those portions of a Specification identified as mandatory to claim conformance, including mandatory portions of any optional feature that is implemented.

**Specification** means any specification, schema, or conformance artifact in this repository that is designated as Covered Materials.

**Conformant Implementation** means an implementation that complies with all Normative Portions of the Specification version it claims to implement.

## 2. Copyright license (redistribution of the spec files)

Subject to the terms of this license, 0PN Lab grants you a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to copy, publish, and distribute the Covered Materials.

## 3. Royalty-free patent license (RF-RAND)

Each Contributor to Covered Materials (and its Affiliates) hereby grants to each Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive patent license under its Essential Claims to make, have made, use, market, import, offer to sell, sell, and otherwise distribute Conformant Implementations of the Specification(s).

This patent license does not extend to:
- non-conformant implementations,
- features not required by the Normative Portions of the Specification(s), or
- patent claims that are not Essential Claims.

## 4. Defensive termination (anti-aggression)

If a Licensee (or its Affiliate) initiates a patent claim against any person or entity alleging that a Conformant Implementation of the Specification infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted to that Licensee under this license terminate automatically as of the date such claim is initiated.

## 5. Reciprocal licensing (optional election)

A Contributor may condition a patent license grant on reciprocal licensing of Essential Claims by the requesting Licensee for the same Specification, on a royalty-free basis, provided such condition is applied in a non-discriminatory manner.

## 6. RAND opt-out declarations (90-day notice; forward-looking only)

A Contributor may publish a written “RAND Opt-Out Declaration” identifying specific Essential Claims (or specific contributions) that the Contributor is unwilling to license on a royalty-free basis for **future versions** of the Specification, subject to:
- a minimum notice period of **90 days** before the declaration becomes effective, and
- **no retroactive effect** on licenses already granted for any previously published Specification versions.

## 7. No warranty

THE COVERED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

## 8. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR OR 0PN LAB BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE COVERED MATERIALS OR THIS LICENSE.

## 9. Relationship to other licenses in this repository

Software code in this repository may be provided under separate open-source licenses (for example Apache-2.0 or MIT). Where a file or directory contains a separate license notice, that separate notice governs the code in that scope.
